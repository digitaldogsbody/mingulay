### Overview
Mingulay is a PHP library for parsing file information out of [Zip files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)).
It searches for the End of Central Directory Record, parses out the data, and then uses this to retrieve the Central Directory Records which contain the metadata of the files in the Zip.

### What's in a name?
[Mingulay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingulay) is an island in the [Hebrides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrides), an archipelago off the west coast of my home country of Scotland, and so it seemed a fitting pick as this library was developed as a contribution towards the fantastic [Archipelago project](https://archipelago.nyc/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/esmero)).

### Installation
Mingulay can be installed via Composer: `composer require digitaldogsbody/mingulay` or alternatively you can clone the repo or download a zip from the releases page and include the contents of `src/` in your project.

### Documentation
Some basic autogenerated PHPDoc documentation is available on GitHub pages: https://digitaldogsbody.github.io/mingulay/. This is automatically updated every time a commit is made to the main branch, and so should always be up-to-date with the latest code.

### Versioning
Mingulay follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) practices. Until release 1.0.0, the interfaces and functionality should be considered unstable and likely to change.

### Usage
Mingulay requires an object that implements the `Mingulay\SeekerInterface` interface. A `LocalFileSeeker` implementation is provided for working with Zip files on disk.

```php
$seeker = new \Mingulay\Seeker\LocalFileSeeker("test/fixtures/single-file.zip");
$zip_info = new \Mingulay\ZipRangeReader($seeker);
var_dump($zip_info->files);
```
```
array(1) {
  'README.md'=>
  array(6) {
    ["file_name"]=>
    string(9) "README.md"
    ["offset"]=>
    int(0)
    ["compressed_size"]=>
    int(43)
    ["uncompressed_size"]=>
    int(43)
    ["CRC32"]=>
    string(8) "C6E036CC"
    ["comment"]=>
    string(0) ""
  }
}
```
Pointers to retrieve individual decompressed files can be acquired with the `getStream()` function:
```php
$seeker = new \Mingulay\Seeker\LocalFileSeeker("test/fixtures/multiple-files.zip");
$zip_info = new \Mingulay\ZipRangeReader($seeker);
$fp = $zip_info->getStream("LICENSE");
$local_fp = fopen("/tmp/example", "wb");
while(!feof($fp)) {
    fwrite($local_fp, fread($fp, 2048));
}
fclose($local_fp);
fclose($fp);
```
